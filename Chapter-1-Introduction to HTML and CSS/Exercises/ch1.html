        <!-- Steps of the Recipe Method -->
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the pancetta. Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and cook according to the packet instructions.</li>
        <li>Squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
        <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop the garlic into the pan, along with the pancetta. Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don't worry if a little water drops in the pan.</li>
        <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
        <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn't scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with a sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish gets too dry, add a little pasta cooking water.</li>
